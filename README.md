**Beautifully designed components you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.**

Sera UI is a reusable component library for React, Next.js, and other JSX-based libraries. Currently, we support `React` and `Next.js` only. Our goal is to create next-level UI with minimal code, optimal performance, and a modern feel.

> 💡 **Why Sera UI?**
>
> “I’m a JavaScript library creator from Bangladesh, not a professional designer. But after building several front-end projects, I realized I needed my own UI system to streamline everything.”
>
> Sera UI is born from real development needs — built by a developer, for developers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can add Sera UI components to your project in two ways: using our CLI for a quick setup or by manually copying the component code for more control.

### CLI Installation

Our CLI will guide you through the process of adding components to your project. Here is an example of how to add the `Button` component:

**npm**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://seraui.seraprogrammer.com/registry/button.json"
```

**pnpm**
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add "https://seraui.seraprogrammer.com/registry/button.json"
```

**yarn**
```bash
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add "https://seraui.seraprogrammer.com/registry/button.json"
```

**bun**
```bash
bunx shadcn@latest add "https://seraui.seraprogrammer.com/registry/button.json"
```

### Manual Installation

For manual installation, you can copy and paste the component code directly from our documentation into your project.

1.  **Choose a Component:** Browse our component library and find what you need.
2.  **Copy the Code:** You can view and copy the source code for each component.
3.  **Paste and Customize:** Paste the code into your project and customize it to fit your needs.

## 🎨 Theming

Sera UI is built on top of **Tailwind CSS**, making it incredibly easy to customize the look and feel to match your brand. You can customize colors, fonts, spacing, and more by simply modifying your `tailwind.config.js` file. The components are unstyled by default and will automatically adapt to your theme.
