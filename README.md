## üé® Theming

Sera UI is built on top of **Tailwind CSS**, making it incredibly easy to customize the look and feel to match your brand. You can customize colors, fonts, spacing, and more by simply modifying your `tailwind.config.js` file. The components are unstyled by default and will automatically adapt to your theme.

### Why Choose Sera UI üíú

| Features                   | **Sera UI** Advantage                                                                      | vs shadcn/ui                                                               | vs Radix UI                                                       | vs DaisyUI / Tailwind UI kits                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Animations & Motion**    | Built-in **Framer Motion** animations for components, text, and effects.                   | shadcn/ui has no animations by default, requires manual setup.             | Radix provides only headless logic (no animations).               | DaisyUI/Tailwind UI have static styles, no animation system.                      |
| **Visual Readiness**       | Components look polished out-of-the-box with design + motion.                              | shadcn/ui is styled but more minimal; less ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor unless customized. | Radix is unstyled primitives.                                     | DaisyUI/Tailwind UI give styles but little focus on modern animated interactions. |
| **Developer Speed**        | Copy-paste or import components with prebuilt effects (badges, toasts, backgrounds, etc.). | shadcn/ui requires setup + Tailwind config alignment.                      | Radix requires you to fully design + style components yourself.   | DaisyUI is quick but less advanced (limited interactivity / effects).             |
| **Modern Design Elements** | Includes **decorative UI effects** (animated text, background effects, interactive grids). | shadcn/ui focuses on functional components only.                           | Radix only covers accessibility/interaction primitives.           | Tailwind UI is static ‚Äî no interactive/decorative extras.                         |
| **Next.js + React Focus**  | Specifically optimized for React/Next.js projects.                                         | shadcn/ui works great with Next, but isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúNext-first‚Äù.                   | Radix is general React, no Next.js optimizations.                 | Tailwind UI/DaisyUI are framework-agnostic, not tailored for React/Next.          |
| **All-in-one Toolkit**     | Mixes **utility effects + components + motion** in one package.                            | shadcn/ui: mainly component code; you add motion separately.               | Radix: only behavior primitives, styling/animations fully manual. | DaisyUI: only styling components, no utilities or motion.                         |
