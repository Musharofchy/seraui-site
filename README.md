# Sera UI - Open-source UI Library for React and Next.js

Sera UI is an open-source UI library loved by developers for React, Next.js, and other JSX frameworks. Built with Tailwind CSS, it makes creating beautiful, interactive and responsive interfaces fast and easy.

**Beautifully designed components you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.**

Sera UI is a reusable component library for React, Next.js, and other JSX-based libraries. Currently, we support `React` and `Next.js` only. Our goal is to create next-level UI with minimal code, optimal performance, and a modern feel.

> 💡 **Why Sera UI?**
>
> “I’m a JavaScript library creator from Bangladesh, not a professional designer. But after building several front-end projects, I realized I needed my own UI system to streamline everything.”
>
> Sera UI is born from real development needs — built by a developer, for developers.

You can customize colors, fonts, spacing, and more by simply modifying your `tailwind.config.js` file. The components are unstyled by default and will automatically adapt to your theme.
