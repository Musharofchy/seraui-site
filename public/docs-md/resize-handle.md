# Resize Handle Text

The **Resize Handle Text** component provides an animated, draggable resize handle with a flipping text effect and a stylish blurry transition. It's perfect for interactive layouts where you want to add a dynamic UI element.

It displays an array of vibrant words that flip as the user interacts with the handleâ€”creating a polished, modern feel for your app or website.

## Customizing Your Flipping Words

You can easily replace the text being flipped with your own words by updating the `phrases` array:

```tsx
const phrases = [
  "AWESOME",
  "BEAUTIFUL",
  "STUNNING",
  "COOL",
  "ELEGANT",
  "AMAZING",
  "VIBRANT",
  "DYNAMIC",
];
