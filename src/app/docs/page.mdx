# Sera UI

**A modern React & Next.js component library — beautifully designed, accessible, and easy to customize.**
Built with **Tailwind CSS** for theming and **Framer Motion** for smooth, delightful animations.

---

## What is Sera UI?

Sera UI is built **by a developer, for developers** — to help you ship elegant, production-ready UIs without fighting with bloated libraries or rigid design systems.

It’s a growing collection of **hand-crafted, reusable React components** built with Tailwind CSS and modern web standards.
Copy the code, drop it into your project, and make it yours.

> ⚡ Not a package. Not a black box. Just code you own and control. -Musharof Chowdhury

Building beautiful interfaces shouldn’t mean wrestling with opinionated component libraries or complex APIs.
Sera UI keeps things simple:

* **Full control** – Every line of code is yours to edit.
* **Modern stack** – React + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript.
* **Faster shipping** – Skip boilerplate, focus on features.
* **Polished design** – Components that look great out of the box.

Whether you’re building a **landing page**, a **dashboard**, or a full-blown web app, Sera UI gives you flexible, production-ready building blocks — **without version conflicts or lock-in**.

## Getting Started

You can use Sera UI in two ways:

1. **Quick Setup with CLI** *(recommended)*
2. **Manual Copy & Paste** *(full control)*

---

### Installation

Run one of the following commands to add a Sera UI component (e.g., `Button`) to your project:

<PMTabs>
  <PNPMTabContent>

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add "https://seraui.com/registry/button.json"
```

  </PNPMTabContent>
  <NPMTabContent>

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://seraui.com/registry/button.json"
```

  </NPMTabContent>
  <YarnTabContent>

```bash
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add "https://seraui.com/registry/button.json"
```

  </YarnTabContent>
  <BunTabContent>

```bash
bunx shadcn@latest add "https://seraui.com/registry/button.json"
```

  </BunTabContent>
</PMTabs>

The CLI sets up the component with Tailwind styling and Framer Motion animations — ready to use right away.
