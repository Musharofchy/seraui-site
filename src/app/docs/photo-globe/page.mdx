# 3D Photo Globe

A fully interactive, responsive 3D globe featuring a grid of photos that dynamically react to user input. Includes hover effects, a popup modal for images, and an atmospheric glow.

<Tabs defaultValue="preview">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="preview">Preview</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="code">Code</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="preview">
    <ComponentRenderer component={<PhotoGlobeView />} />
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="code">
    <CodeBlock filePath="src/app/docs/photo-globe/photo-globe.tsx" />
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Features

- **Fully Interactive 3D Scene**: Built with Three.js for a smooth, hardware-accelerated experience.
- **Responsive & Centered**: The globe automatically resizes and centers itself to fit any container, from full-screen to small divs.
- **Dynamic Hover Effects**: Photo patches lift off the surface and emit a subtle glow when hovered over.
- **Image Popup Modal**: Clicking a photo opens it in a clean, centered overlay with a backdrop.
- **Atmospheric Glow**: A beautiful shader-based glow effect gives the globe a sense of depth and realism.
- **Auto-Rotation**: The globe gently spins by default, which can be paused and resumed via UI controls.
- **Dark Theme**: A sleek, dark, space-themed aesthetic that fits modern UIs.
- **Optimized Performance**: Efficiently manages rendering and event listeners within a React `useEffect` hook for optimal performance and cleanup.

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

The component is self-contained and designed to fill its parent container. For the best results, place it inside a container with a defined height.

```tsx 
import PhotoGlobe from './photo-globe';

export function Example() {
  return (
    <div className="relative w-full h-[700px]">
      <PhotoGlobe />
    </div>
  );
}
```
